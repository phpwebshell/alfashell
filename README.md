ALFA TEaM Shell ~ v4.1-Tesla
New release v4.1 Alfa Team Shell
ALFA TEaM Shell ~ v4.1-Tesla, released on Monday, September 14, 2020
One group that has released a new version of their PHP web shell is ALFA TEaM, a suspected Iranian group that creates web malware like ALFA TEaM Shell, which in the past has been used by threat actors like APT 33 who have targeted energy and aerospace industries in the past. If you are interested, a detailed analysis on group APT 33’s tactics has been documented by FireEye.

Website owners may begin to wonder why they would find the same PHP shell, ALFA TEaM Shell, on their website that has nothing to do with the industries targeted by threat actors using this malware?

The answer lies in the fact that attackers often need a large amount of distributed resources that help facilitate malware or phishing delivery to their desired target. This could range from resources like “aged” websites that aren’t blacklisted, clean IP addresses from various providers and geographical locations, known email accounts, or anything else that may give credibility to their campaign.

For example, assets that help an attacker successfully deliver their malware payload via email are resources like an aged email account, a SMTP server not operating on a blacklisted IP address, and similar resources. Without these resources their malicious email has a much lower chance of ever reaching the inbox of a victim.

As it turns out, it’s simply less effort for attackers to compromise other people’s websites rather than spend time and money creating an elaborate network of aged websites located around the world.

From the attacker’s perspective, all it takes is one or two blacklistings for a website and all of their hard work in acquiring the domain, setting up scraped content, and waiting, would be wasted.

If they don’t have to create, maintain, and age a domain and can instead gain unauthorized access to a vulnerable third party website, it’s much more efficient for them.

New Features
Web shell features for Alfa Team Shell
The number of offered features make this a sort of an “all-in-one” web shell
The ALFA-TEaM shell contains an enormous number of features, so today I will focus primarily on new or updated features for the latest version v4.1.

When comparing v4.1’s PHP code, we can see the following new features, which are not present in v3 of the web shell:

'dumper'    ➠    'Database Dumper',
'coldumper'    ➠    'Column Dumper',
'deziper'    ➠    'DeCompressor',
'fakepage'    ➠    'Fake Page',
'config_grabber'    ➠    'Config Grabber',
'archive_manager'    ➠    'Archive Manager',
The first three are just variations of existing features (e.g coldumper) and relatively common among multi-featured PHP web shells.

Let’s focus on the behavior of the last three features: fakepage, config_grabber, and archive_manager.
